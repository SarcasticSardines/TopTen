          <p class="standard">If you've been paying attention to mainstream media for the past 25 years or so, there's a good chance you know what Pokemon are. If you're unfamiliar, Pokemon is a franchise that started with Game Boy games where you catch and fight with monsters, but has evolved over the last couple decades into one of the most popular and profitable media franchises in the world. Nowadays, there are over 1000 Pokemon, or "Pocket Monsters" featured, and any category of Pokemon merchandise you can think of.</p>
          <p class="standard">Knowing what Pokemon is now, we can explore the different variations of Pokemon. Some Pokemon have visual changes between male and female, but there is one rare variation that all Pokemon have: a shiny form. Shiny Pokemon, originally referred to simply as "rare Pokemon", were extremely rare Pokemon that had a different color palette from their standard versions. There is a 1/4096 of encountering a shiny Pokemon every time you encounter a Pokemon in the wild, so they are extremely hard to find!</p>
          <p class="standard">Shiny Pokemon palettes were originally rumored to be chosen by an algorithm, however the fact is that all shiny Pokemon colorations are individually defined in the data of the games. With this in mind, I have gone through all 1021 Pokemon (as of writing this) and chosen from it the shiny colorations that I feel are the best. My goal was to choose the ones I feel contrasted the original palettes the best, ones that made significant tonal changes from the originals, and ones that have cohesive palettes. Without further ado, here is my list of the 10 best shiny Pokemon.</p>

The warm orange is swapped for a purple-toned dark grey, and the eyes and wing interiors are filled with a crimson red rather than dark blue. The soft yellow of the belly stays the same, and offers a nice contrast to the darker toned colors that take up a majority of the palette.</p>

Reffering to them collectively as the Tapus, there are 4 types of Tapu: Tapu Koko the electric fairy, Tapu Lele the psychic fairy, Tapu Bulu the grass fairy, and Tapu Fini the water fairy. Their Shiny colorations swap out the main colors of their "masks" for black, and their accent colors are desaturated to enhance the "darkened" look.</p>

This Pokemon has three forms, but the color swap is the same between them all so I have only included the visual for its 100% form. The main black coloration is swapped for white, and the bright lime green is swapped for a soothing darker teal-green. Softening the green absolutely helps the cohesion of this palette.</p>

Gengar's standard form has a much different (and very disappointing) shiny palette, but generation 6 brought the addition of Mega Evolutions and with it, different shiny colorations as well. Shiny Mega Gengar takes a sharp turn from the dark purple base of the original to replace it with a stark white, as well as replacing the iconic red eyes with an intimidating dark grey, but keeping the pink accents the same.</p>

The yellow band and ring patterns on its fur are swapped for a cyan blue, and the intimidating red eyes are now a softer yellow, but the main black coloration is kept the same to keep the palette high in contrast.</p>

The accent colors are not changed drastically; the orange of the "tie" and spots is swapped for a redder tone, and the leafy green for a darker teal. The biggest change to the palette though (that arguably adds the best contrast) is the light brown of the cloak that is transformed into black, changing the color palette into something darker that fits the description of an owl-archer a little better.</p>

          <p class="standard">Fighting for the second highest spot on the list, we have Shiny Greninja at number 2. This palette is another simple, yet effective color swap- instead of dark blue there is black, and the soft yellow/tan is replaced with a dark grey that almost blends into the black. The red and blue accent of the scarf, eyes, and head fins stay the same, providing the only contrast to the dark colors. The palette is very fitting for a Pokemon inspired by shinobi and other midnight assassin roles.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p class="standard">Holding the title of the best shiny Pokemon at number 1, we have Shiny Mega Gardevoir. Gardevoir's standard shiny form is very similar, but there is one big palette difference between them that elevates the Mega Evolution to the top spot. The green "hair" is swapped for cyan blue, and the red eyes and spikes are replaces with an almost burnt orange. The largest change is the addition of black; to the lower half of the body and forearms, almost mimicking the appearance of a black dress and opera gloves. This color addition to the shiny version is what stands it above the rest- it's both a unique (from the original) and a cohesive palette that make this a shiny Pokemon to remember.</p>
