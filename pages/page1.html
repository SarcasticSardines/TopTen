              <p>Princess Zelda's Final Smash is a very powerful and effective attack. She uses her power of the Triforce to suck in an enemy and swallows them up into a Triforce hole (like a black hole) and then, depending on how much damage they have taken beforehand, either fly far across the field or instantly blow up and lose a point.</p>

If the limbs come into contact with an opponent or more, she will summon Gamorrah, a demon, who consume any unfortunate opponent that's in front of it. All you can do is pray that you aren't one of those unlucky opponents.</p>

              <p>When transformed, Super Sonic only flies across the screen back and forth. This is still effective, however. The player can move the joycon up or down to make Super Sonic fly across the bottom, middle, or top part of the screen. The only way to avoid this is to either find a way to stay on the top part off-screen or stay on the little pad that brings you back when you get knocked out.</p>
