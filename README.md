* Project: "Your Favorite Top Ten"
* Peer reviewed by: Xavier Hopkins, The website shines in some areas and is lacking personality others. If you go to one of the top ten lists, then try to load another, then you'll get an error. This happens everytime you try to load a 2nd page. When the website does work, The landing page looks good, and the shiny pokemon page looks preety good as well. The final smash list has a long gap of space with nothing in it and there's only one video on each Top 10. Would of been nice if you added some pics and more vids. Overall, I could see what you guys were going for, just wasn't executed the best.
